### Environment setup
You are required to download ffmpeg.exe into the same folder as the python script in order for this to compile. Github has a 100mb limit so it's not included in the repo. You can download ffmpeg from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

### Building EXE
To build, simply run build.bat. The output will be a single dist\WebcamRTSP.exe file that you can distribute.
